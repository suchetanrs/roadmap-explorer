# if exploration in slam mode, this will create a fresh exploration instance. It is recommended to also restart the mapping session from the slam before launching the exploration.
# if exploration in localisation only mode, this will start a fresh exploration instance.

# if exploration in slam mode, this will continue from the last terminated exploration instance that's in memory but with the updated input map from the slam.
# if exploration in localisation only mode, this will contine from the last terminated exploration instance but with the last mapping session from sensor simulator.

# if exploration in slam mode, this mode will not run since it relies on sensor simulator.
# if exploration in localisation only mode, this will continue from the loaded exploration map and the loaded frontier roadmap.
